# AI Dev Workflow

The simplest AI coding setup that actually ships products.

## Setup

### 1. Install OpenClaw

```bash
npm install -g openclaw
```

### 2. Initialize your workspace

```bash
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
openclaw init
```

### 3. Connect a model

```bash
openclaw config
```

Set your preferred AI model (Claude, GPT, etc.) and API key.

### 4. Start building

```bash
openclaw start
```

Talk to your AI like a coworker:

> "I want to build a Discord bot that tracks stock prices. What's the best approach?"

That's it. You now have an AI partner that lives in your project, knows your code, and helps you build.

## What I've built with this

- Real-time trading dashboard (Discord Activity)
- Data pipeline (560k+ records)
- Market data API
- Discord bots

All solo. Under $20/mo infrastructure.
