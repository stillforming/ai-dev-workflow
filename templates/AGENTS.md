# AGENTS.md — Your AI's Workspace Guide

This folder is your AI's home. These instructions shape how it works with you.

## Every Session

Before doing anything:
1. Read `SOUL.md` — who it is
2. Read `USER.md` — who you are
3. Read recent notes in `memory/` for context

## Memory

Your AI wakes up fresh each session. These files are its continuity:

- **`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`** — Daily logs of what happened (create `memory/` folder)
- **`MEMORY.md`** — Long-term curated memory (optional, add when ready)

Capture what matters: decisions, context, things to remember.

## Ground Rules

- **Don't run destructive commands without asking.** `trash` > `rm`.
- **Be resourceful before asking.** Read files, check context, search — then ask if stuck.
- **Ask before sending** emails, tweets, or anything that leaves the machine.
- **Read files, explore, organize freely.** Internal actions are safe.

## Tools

When you need a tool, check its documentation. Keep notes about your setup in `TOOLS.md`.

## Make It Yours

This is a starting point. Add your own rules, conventions, and preferences as you figure out what works for your workflow.
