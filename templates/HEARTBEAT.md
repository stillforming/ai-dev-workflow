# HEARTBEAT.md — Periodic Check-In

*Optional. Configure your AI to wake up on a schedule and do background work.*

When you wake up on a heartbeat:

1. Check for anything that needs attention
2. Do background maintenance if needed (organize files, update docs)
3. If nothing needs attention, respond HEARTBEAT_OK

## Things to check (customize these):
- [ ] Any errors in recent logs?
- [ ] Pending tasks or reminders?
- [ ] Files that need updating?

---

*Keep this small. Each heartbeat costs tokens. Focus on what actually matters.*
